# Brevia AI - Multi-Agent AI Platform

## Overview

Brevia AI is a full-stack web application that provides specialized AI agents for different tasks including research, note generation, document creation, resume building, and presentation creation. The platform features a modern chat interface where users can interact with different AI agents, each designed for specific workflows and capabilities.

The application is built as a monorepo with a React TypeScript frontend and Express.js backend, utilizing PostgreSQL for data persistence and Drizzle ORM for database operations. The platform supports real-time agent workflows with progress tracking and multi-source content generation.
